School Discipline and Students’ Welfare

Upholding Discipline:

After the bell the school gates will be closed and entry will be permitted only through gate no. 1 (the main gate)
Disciplinary action will be taken against those who are habitually late.
School uniform is a discipline in itself and should be adhered to by all students. Students are expected to wear the school uniform in a proper manner as specified by the school.
Changing classrooms between periods should be done in silence and in an orderly manner.
Students are advised to keep their classrooms / school building / campus neat and clean. Waste material and leftovers must be thrown into the dustbins only.
Students should observe polite civil behaviour. Shouting, bullying or use of foul language is forbidden.
Under no pretext should a student miss any teaching / games / activity period. In case a teacher is absent, alternate arrangements are made by the time table incharge.
Code of Conduct:

The following undesirable behaviour / repeated indiscipline will lead to serious consequences even leading to expulsion, if not corrected:

Damaging school furniture, fixtures / building or things belonging to others.

Recommendations to Parents/Guardians

Parents are requested

to closely monitor their ward’s progress by checking the school almanac everyday and paying attention to their punctuality, discipline and submission of school assignments.
to encourage their ward to take a balanced interest in studies, co-curricular activities and sports.
to inform the school immediately if there is any change in address, telephone numbers and bus route.
to ensure that their ward does not bring expensive items, electronic items, cell phones etc. or large sum of money to school. The school bags should be randomly checked to ensure the same.
to restrict pocket money to a minimal. Excessive spending in school should be discouraged.
to restrict celebration of birthdays of your ward in school to simple distribution of candies. Elaborate arrangements like cutting of cake & partying in the class are not permitted.
to explain to the child the need to look after his/her belongings. The school does not accept responsibility for any item lost in school. All articles belonging to the child should have identification details.
to ensure that their ward is in proper school uniform. No fancy jewellery like danglers, trinkets, studs etc. should be worn by girls/boys.
to ensure that their ward does not wear/carry smart watch to school.
to keep leave for half a day to a minimal as far as possible. In case of an emergency, written permission must be taken from the Principal / Vice Principal/ Headmistress and the Class Rep/ Class Teacher. In case a child leaves the school early it is mandatory to inform the Bus Incharge about the same.
to ensure that during their ward’s absence from school, work done in the class is made up for.
to provide a supportive value-based environment to their ward at home. Using discretion and parental judgement, keep track of their ward’s mental health and emotions.
to monitor the internet sites being visited by their ward and limit Television viewing to appropriate programmes and duration.
contact school to discuss and decide a plan of action to handle the difficulties (academic as well as behavioural) of their ward and to seek guidance. Your letters will be replied to after discussion with the concerned teachers.
to ensure that their ward appears for all tests as per the schedule given in the Almanac. In case the child is unable to take the examination, prior intimation must be given to the Class Teacher in writing.
to discourage their ward from taking additional leave before the commencement of examinations. 
Note: Carrying electronic gadgets, cell phones or smart watches by students is strictly prohibited within the school premises. If any student is found in possession of the same during school hours, strict disciplinary action will be taken against him/her by the school authorities.</h3>
